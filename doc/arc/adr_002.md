# Put delivery component into Inventory subdomain

Date: 10/23

## Status

accepted 

## Context

Initial component discovery contains generic subdomains such as: Order, Billing and Shipping&Delivery. 

## Decision

Merge Shipping&Deleivery subdomain into Inventory subdomain. Reasons:
+ The business model of FarmacyFood does not use a traditional shipping and delivery model. The delivery actually means re-stocking into the SmartFridge, which is part of the inventory management subdomain.
+ Inventory is a core subdomain of the system, how to restock(Shipping&Delivery in other words) is an essential part it.

## Consequences
